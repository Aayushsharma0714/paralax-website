       <h2 class="secheading">Adventure Time</h2>
        <p class="text">Adventure” this word itself is an invitation to massive adrenaline rush, number of emotions such as excitement, fear, nervousness, thrill & danger are felt all at once on thinking about it. Technically, adventure is an unusual & daring experience. People usually go for an adventure trip in their leisure time so as to revive their spirit after utterly exhausting schedule of routine life.
       <br><br>
        While the definition of adventure can vary from person to person, in broader context “risk taken when its outcome is unknown” can be termed as adventure. It is something that challenges you, it is something that lets you escape from your ordinary lives & thus it is something that changes you. It can make you feel more live & refreshed. Adventures can be sought in numerous ways such as mountaineering, river rafting, trekking, skydiving, scuba diving, etc. Even exploring new people & cities can be considered as an adventure.

            Adventure in many ways has been proven beneficial for us. Surmounting a challenge during an adventure is a brilliant way to leave us feeling positive about ourselves & thus has a positive impact on our mental health. Adventure & exploration can also really help us expand our horizons about nature, culture & more. Sometimes, it can also help us have a deeper insight about ourselves. This happens when we let ourselves loose in an unfamiliar situation. It can let our hidden strengths unveil and make us push our limits.

        <p class="text">When I first learnt to ride a bicycle, I felt excited. That evening, I went on my own around the neighbourhood. After a while, I decided to go to my friend’s house for a game of badminton. On my way there, however, I was chased by a fierce dog. I pedaled as fast as I could but it sprang at me and caught my leg. I shouted and fell off my bicycle. My knees were bruised and I was badly shaken. Fortunately, the dog let go of my leg, but, before I could ride again, it sprang once more at me and barked. Nervously, I managed to get on the saddle after which I rode off without looking back. Much to my relief, the dog soon gave up chasing me. But, by then, I was too tired to play badminton. So, after a short rest in my friend’s house, I left for home, taking another route this time. Half way home, I had a puncture and had to push my bicycle all the way. Finally, I reached home, feeling exhausted after the evening’s adventure on a bicycle.

    </div>
    <p class="text">Paragliding is a sport in which the players fly in the air using paragliders. These paragliders are light in weight and are foot launched. There is a harness in the glider on which the paraglider sits. This harness is interconnected to the glider with baffled cells. We will learn various aspects of this adventurous in the chapters that follow.
        <br><br>
        aragliding demands jumping from high heels and to ski in the air for long hours. Therefore, a hill station having a stiff peak and a wide area for surfing in the air will be a suitable environment. If it will be played in any normal crowded area, then it is obvious that the user will face difficulty while paragliding.
The area must also be free from any airline path so that the player should not face any emergency landing system due to an airplane approach. Adequate safety and protection must be taken care of before flying so that player can fly comfortably for long hours.

     <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/surfing/" class="link">   <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2></a>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
            The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
        <br><br>
        Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the surfer's own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand.
